# Project 3

This project explores spatial predator-prey dynamics via simulation in three ways; firstly, via a numerical solution of the Lotka-Volterra (LV) system of differential equations, secondly, via a two-species Cellular Automaton (CA) model that resembles a realistic scenario as close as possible, and thirdly, via a probabilistic CA model that bridges the LV model and our CA approach.

Overall, we simulate localized interactions of prey and predator populations on a 2D lattice and investigate how macroscopic phenomena such as population cycles, spatial pattern formation, and bifurcations arise from microscopic rules.

This repository hosts our code and results, which can be replicated by executing the given files, assuring that the minimal requirements in the 'requirements.txt' file are satisfied.
